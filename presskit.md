## Description
After irresponsibly gambling away all your money, you find yourself in debt to the Yakuza! With a katana-weilding Crane knocking at your door, you had one last-ditch-effort up your sleeve.... a Hanafuda Deck?... Welp, better than nothing!

By using cards as your weapon, you must defeat the Yakuza in a game of HanaFUEDa! Will you go for broke and best your opponenet? Or succumb to defeat with the very cards that put you here in the first place?


## Overview
Hanafueda pits you against the Yakuza, having you balance between saving card combos while trying to search through the deck as best as you can! The Yakuza will attempt to strike you where you stand, attacking you directly and inflicting effects to mess with your plays! The game also includes:
* Orignal 2D sprites and cutscenes!
* Original musical compositions!
* Secret synergies that trigger effects!
  
And of course... **GAMBLING!**
